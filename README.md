# PLL
Phase locked loop algorithm implemented for gird synchronization.

Two kinds of algorithm are provided.
1. An algorithm implemented according to the default implementation of PLL from MATLAB/Simulink library.
2. Second order generic integrator based phase lock loop, which cost less memory and run faster.
