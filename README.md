# PLL
Phase locked loop algorithm implemented for gird synchronization.

Three kinds of algorithm are provided.
1. MATLAB:an algorithm implemented according to the default implementation of PLL from MATLAB/Simulink library.
2. SOGI_PLL: second order generalized integrator based phase-locked loop.
3. FLL: second order generalized integrator based frequency-locked loop.
